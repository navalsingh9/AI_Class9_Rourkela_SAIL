💡 "Where young minds meet machine intelligence — from India’s Steel City to the world."

🌍 About the Project

Smart Steel, Smart Minds is a hands-on Artificial Intelligence learning project built around Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) — India’s first integrated steel plant under SAIL (Steel Authority of India Limited).

This repository helps Class IX CBSE students explore:

🔹 Basics of Python programming

🔹 Real-world AI concepts like data, decision-making & visualization

🔹 The role of AI in modern industries like steel manufacturing

🔹 Responsible AI and ethics for a sustainable future

🎯 Learning Goals
Theme	Skill Developed
Python Programming	Input/Output, Variables, Logic, Loops
AI Basics	Problem Scoping, Data & Decision Making
Visualization	Understanding Graphs with Matplotlib
Ethics & Sustainability	Responsible use of AI
Industry Connection	Real-world context via RSP examples

🧩 Project Highlight — Smart Steel Tracker

This mini project shows how AI can analyze production data to identify efficiency patterns — the same kind of logic used by modern steel plants!

python smart_steel_tracker.py


What happens:

Loads data from production_data_rsp.csv

Calculates daily efficiency (Output ÷ Energy Used)

Shows top 3 most efficient days

Plots a graph of results 📈
